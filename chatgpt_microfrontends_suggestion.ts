The application needs to support server-side rendering, in order to provide a good user experience and improve performance.
The application needs to support client-side navigation, in order to provide a seamless and responsive user experience.
The application needs to use a microfrontend architecture, in order to modularize the codebase and allow for independent development and deployment of the different components.
The application needs to be able to dynamically load the routes and components for each microfrontend at runtime, in order to support a flexible and customizable architecture.
The application needs to be able to handle absolute URLs for the main components of the microfrontends, in order to support independent deployment of the microfrontends.
The application needs to be able to handle relative import paths for the main components of the microfrontends, in order to support server-side rendering and avoid errors.
The application needs to use a deployment strategy that allows for zero-downtime updates, in order to minimize downtime and improve availability.
